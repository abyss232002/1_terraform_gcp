Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.

Ans:~/dezoomcamp2024/abyss232002_git/data-engineering-zoomcamp/01-docker-terraform/1_terraform_gcp$ terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.demo-dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "demo-dataset" {
      + creation_time              = (known after apply)
